## Detailed Description
```
Export your Twitter/X bookmarks and followers/following lists that are missing from the official Twitter data export.

FEATURES:
• Export all your Twitter/X bookmarks to JSON format
• Export your followers list
• Export your following list
• One-click export with progress tracking
• Automatic scrolling and data collection
• Deduplicated results
• No data sent to external servers - all processing happens locally

HOW TO USE:
1. Navigate to your Twitter/X bookmarks page (twitter.com/i/bookmarks or x.com/i/bookmarks)
2. Click the extension icon
3. Choose what to export (Bookmarks, Followers, or Following)
4. Wait for the export to complete
5. Your data will be downloaded as a JSON file

PRIVACY:
This extension processes all data locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers or third parties. All your data stays on your computer.

EXTRACTED DATA:
For bookmarks:
- Tweet text content
- Author information
- Timestamp
- Tweet URL and ID

For followers/following:
- User profiles and metadata

WHY USE THIS?
When you download your Twitter data archive (Settings → Your account → Download an archive of your data), Twitter does NOT include your bookmarks or complete follower/following lists. This extension fills that gap.

OPEN SOURCE:
This extension is open source. You can review the code and contribute on GitHub.

SUPPORT:
